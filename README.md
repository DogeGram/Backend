> As per point I.1 YOU ARE PHOHIBITED TO USE THIS SOURCE FOR COMMERCIAL USE. THIS OVERRIDES ANY LICENCES THAT WOULD APPLY. This would apply to any and every commit before this README change was made in this repository (https://github.com/DogeGram/Backend)

## Much Contributions
Contributions are welcome! Changes on the `controllers/authController.js` file need to be tagged `auth` (and will be reviewed by me) cause I saw this video and scared to let that happen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q)
